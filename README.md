# FixRDAR4XR11
Fix RDAR issue when Dynamic Island is enabled on iPhone XR/11, 17.0 to 18.0 RC1

### Pro (compared to MDC/KFD method)
- This is applied permanently (does not disappear after a reboot or respring)

### Cons
- Some UI may bug out after the resolution changes (the plist we provided here comes with an `optimized` resolution for XR/11, so everything should work fine)
- 50/50 chance of a boot loop if something is done incorrectly

## For Windows
1. Download [Cowabunga Lite for Windows](https://github.com/Avangelista/CowabungaLiteWindows)
2. Download the plist file from [Releases](https://github.com/HorizonUnix/FixRDAR4XR11/releases)
3. Open Cowabunga Lite for Windows and connect your iPhone to your PC

5. Paste the plist you just downloaded into the `mobile` folder

6. Go back to Cowabunga Lite, click the Apply tab, and then press the Apply button, the device will reboot after that
7. After applying the resolution, use [MisakaX](https://github.com/straight-tamago/misakaX) or Nugget to enable Dynamic Island (2796)
